# Fillit

42 Silicon Valley Project  
[Project Instructions](fillit.en.pdf)

C Project that reads in Tetrimino pieces (like Tetris) and fits them all into the smallest square possible with optimization through bitwise operations to improve the algorithms speeds.

Implemented with a backtracking alorgithm to test every possible decision within the exponentially large decision tree that is possible.
